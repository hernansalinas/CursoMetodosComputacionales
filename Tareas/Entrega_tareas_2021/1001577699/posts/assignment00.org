* Implementation of the factorial algorithm

In order to compute the factorial of an arbitrary positive integer n, we need not resort to an explicit algebraic expression for such a function, but rather establish a recursive routine by using a list of numbers.

The function receives a value $n$ and builds up a list beginning with the number 1 (that is, $a_1$) with the recursion:
\[
a_n =n\cdot a_{n-1},
\]
this means that the first few iterations yield
\begin{gather*}
a_2 = 2 \cdot a_1 = 2 \cdot 1, \\
a_3 = 3 \cdot a_2 = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1, \\
a_4 = 4 \cdot a_3 = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1,
\end{gather*}
and so on and so forth, until arriving at the value $a_n$. The function just returns the last item on the list.

* Algorithms on the divisors of a number

This algorithm addresses to the following definitions:
- *Defective numbers* A number $n$ is called defective (or deficient) if the sum of its proper divisors is less than $n$.
- *Abundant numbers* An excessive number is a number that is smaller than the sum of its proper divisors.
- *Amicable numbers* Two different numbers such that the sum of the proper divisors of each is equal to the other number.
- *Semi-perfect numbers* There exists a subset of its proper divisors whose sum is equal to the number.
- *Perfect numbers* The sum of /all/ of its proper divisors is equal to the number.
- *Prime numbers* The number is only divisible by itself and by 1.

Firstly, we must obtain a list of the divisors of the given numbers. As a justification for the method we shall introduce, we need state explicitly the fact that, for any positive integer $n$, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the divisors of $n$ that are less than $\sqrt{n}$ and those which are greater than $\sqrt{n}$.

Note that if $d$ divides $n$, then $n$ might as well be written as a product of two integers in the following manner: $n=(n/d) \cdot d$. Hence $n/d$ would also divide $n$. Now, if $n$ is a perfect square (so that $d=\sqrt{n}$ divides $n$), then $n/d = \sqrt{n} = d$, so both numbers would be exactly the same divisor; otherwise $d$ and $n/d$ will be different divisors of $n$. With this in mind, we may proceed by considering that if we have a divisor $d < \sqrt{n}$, then $d \sqrt{n} < n$, which is to say $n/d > \sqrt{n}$; whereas if $d > \sqrt{n}$, then $n/d < \sqrt{n}$. Hence we have an equivalence:
$$
d < \sqrt{n} \Leftrightarrow n/d > \sqrt{n},
$$
which establishes the desired relation and allows us to find all divisors of an integer by iterating up to $\sqrt{n}$.

In order to decide whether a given positive integer abides by the definition of semi-perfect, we must regard what is known as the subset sum problem, viz., we must tell if given an arbitrary set of positive integers, we can extract some subset of it such that the sum of its elements yields a fixed value. In our particular case, we must evaluate subsets of the set of divisors of a number.

To compute this in an effective way, we turn to dynamic programming. Suppose we have the number $n$ and a list of its proper divisors; the idea is to construct a boolean matrix that relates subsets up to a certain value of the list of divisors with the possibility of them summing up to a quantity between 0 and $n$. To be fair it is not so simple to put into words, but an image may clear things up:

|     | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | ... | n |
|-----+---+---+---+---+-----+---|
| 0   | T | F | F | F | ... | F |
| d1  | T |   |   |   |     |   |
| d2  | T |   |   |   |     |   |
| d3  | T |   |   |   |     |   |
| ... | T |   |   |   |     |   |
| dm  | T |   |   |   |     |   |

Each row is associated to an element on the ordered list of divisors $(0,d_1,d_2,\dots,d_m)$, which can be truncated up to the k-th element as $(0,a_1,\dots,a_k)$. (Note that we have appended the number 0 at the beginning of this list.) Each column is associated to an integer between 0 and $n$.

An element in the $(i,j)$ position of this array is True ($T$) if there is a subset of the truncated list up to the i-th element (viz., a subset of $(0,a_1,\dots,a_i)$) which adds up to $j$.

Here the first column tells us that, for a list truncated up to any element of the divisor list, there is a subset that can add up to 0; this is taken as a tautology, for we defined the 0-th element to be 0. On the other hand, 0 cannot add up to a number greater than itself, that is why the elements of the first row must be False ($F$).

The empty matrix shown above will be filled according to two simple rules, which are indeed plausible. Suppose we require the value of an element in the $(i,j)$ position:
- If $j < d_i$ and the element $(i-1,j)$ is False, then there is no way we can add up to $j$ with a number that is greater than $j$; hence $(i,j)$ would be False too. On the other hand, if the element $(i-1,j)$ is True, then it follows that any truncated list past $d_{i-1}$ will contain at least one subset that adds up to $j$; thus $(i,j)$ would be true.
- If $j \geq d_i$ and the value of $(i-1,j)$ is True, we already know that $(i,j)$ will be also True; but even if $(i,j)$ is False there is the possibility that some subset of $(0,d_1,\dots,d_{i-1})$ gives the value $j - d_i$. If such a subset happens to exist, then the value of $(i,j)$ must be True. Hence $(i,j)$ will be False only if both the above conditions are False.

Simply put:
- If $j < d_i$, then $(i,j) = (i-1,j)$.
- If $j \geq d_i$, then $(i,j) = (i-1,j) \text{ or } (i-1,j-d_i)$.

* Palindrome number

This is an easy one, we need only evaluate a given number as if it is a string of characters, thus as if it is a list. We just decide whether the reversed list is exactly the same as the original one.
#+begin_src ipython :session asession :exports both :results raw output
def palindrome(number) :
        string = str(number)
        if string[0:] == string[::-1] :

        else :
                print(False)
#+end_src

* Evaluating a string

This equally comes down to manipulating a list of characters.
#+begin_src ipython :session asession :exports both :results raw output
def string(string) :
        chars = []
        vocals = 'aeiou'

        if len(string) % 2 == 0 :
                 chars.append(False)
        elif string[int(len(string) / 2)] in vocals :
                chars.append(True)
        else :
                chars.append(False)

        vocals_in_str = 0
        consonants_in_str = 0
        for i in string :
                if i in vocals :
                        vocals_in_str += 1
                else :
                        consonants_in_str += 1
        chars.append(vocals_in_str)
        chars.append(consonants_in_str)

        chars.append(string[::-1])

        print(chars)

* The Fibonacci sequence

Much like the first exercise, this is a recursion, which in this case is given by the formula
\begin{gather*}
F_1 = 1, \\
F_2 = 1, \\
F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
\end{gather*}

        print(fib_list[-2])

* Quicksort

Quicksort is an efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm for ordering a list of numbers. It works by selecting a pivot form a given array and deciding whether or not the rest of the elements in it are less than or greater than the pivot. The basic methodology we shall follow is based on "partitions", or subarrays taken from the original one; we arbitrarily set the rightmost element on the list to be the pivot and then establish a well-defined process to extract two non-overlapping arrays, one containing elements which are greater than the pivot, and the other one containing elements which are less than it.

To begin with, notice that the key element in our algorithm must be the "partitioning" routine, which comprises the basis for the rest of the iterative process. As to make the aforementioned process feasible, we define two pointers, each associated with a different condition; obviously, these conditions ought to be the order relations: "greater than" (>) and "less than" (<), which are going to be evaluated by taking the pivot as a reference. We initialise the "less than" pointer at the leftmost point on the list, whereas the "greater than pointer" must begin at the point just to the left of the pivot.

How do these pointers actually work? The behaviour of these objects may well be clarified through an example: Suppose we have an array of numbers $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n-1},x_n)$; in the beginning, the (<) pointer is at the position of $x_1$, and its function is to evaluate whether the condition $x_1 < x_n$ is indeed satisfied. Similarly, the (>) pointer is initially at the position of $x_{n-1}$, and it checks for the validity of the statement $x_{n-1}>x_n$.

Three straightforward rules must be followed by these pointers, namely:
 - As long as the value associated to (<) is less than that corresponding to (>), apply the following rules.
 - If the first condition is unmet, exchange the position of the pivot with that of the (<) pointer, stop the whole process, and return the index (or position) of the (<) pointer, this value will become the "partition point" for the list, viz., the index that separates "greater than values" from "less than values".
 - Whenever the condition they bear is satisfied, move to the "next position"; this amounts to "move right" for the (<) pointer, and "move left" for the (>) pointer.

The algorithm will repeatedly apply this process, firstly on the original array, and subsequently on the partitions of the list; each partition is defined by an index, which in turn fixes the ending point of one list and the beginning of another.
#+begin_src ipython :session asession :exports both :results raw output
def partition(array, lowest_index, greatest_index) :
    pivot = array[greatest_index]
    less_pointer = lowest_index
    greater_pointer = greatest_index - 1

    while True :
        if array[greater_pointer] >= pivot and less_pointer <= greater_pointer:
            greater_pointer -= 1

        if array[less_pointer] <= pivot and less_pointer <= greater_pointer:
            less_pointer += 1

        if less_pointer > greater_pointer :
            break
        else:
            array[less_pointer], array[greater_pointer] = array[greater_pointer], array[less_pointer]

    array[less_pointer], array[greatest_index] = array[greatest_index], array[less_pointer]
    return less_pointer

def quick_sort_wrapper(array, lowest_index, greatest_index) :
    if greatest_index == lowest_index :
            return array
    if lowest_index < greatest_index:
            partitionIndex = partition(array, lowest_index, greatest_index)
            # apply the same algorithm to resulting partitions
            quick_sort_wrapper(array,lowest_index,partitionIndex-1)
